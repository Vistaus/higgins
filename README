Higgins:
Application launcher,
starts applications and search for things.

Currently it:
* Evaluate expressions (calculator)
* Find recently opened documents
* Find desktop applications
* Find executables
* Find local bookmarks
* Lists the content of folders
* Find files by indexing user-specified folders

If you miss some functionality, i've to know that higgins
supports external plugins located in ~/.config/gambas3/higgins/extbin/
and since parses the external plugin output, the plugins can be written 
in any language, from bash to c++!
Take a look to External_plugin_locate.sh or External_plugin_kill.sh
