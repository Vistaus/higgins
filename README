Higgins:
-----------------------------
Application launcher,
starts applications and search for things.



Internal plugins:
-----------------------------
* Evaluate expressions (calculator)
* Find recently opened documents
* Find desktop applications
* Find executables
* Find local bookmarks
* Lists the content of folders
* Find files by indexing user-specified folders



External plugins:
-----------------------------
higgins also supports plugins located in ~/.config/gambas3/higgins/extbin/
and since it parses the external plugin output,
the plugins can be written in any language, from bash to c++!
Take a look to External_plugin_locate.sh or External_plugin_kill.sh




Mandatory requirements:
-----------------------------
  * Gambas 3 (usually the very latest version)



Recommended tools:
-----------------------------
  * xbindkeys (higgins use it to register a global X11 shortcut)
